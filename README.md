TÃ´ Na Puc?
----------
Android app to check if the user is near the PUC Betim

----------
Application created by students Jean Duarte and Marcio Mansur for Distributed Application Development course, taught by Prof. Dr. Sandro Laudares at PUC Minas campus Betim.

The application idea is to enable the user to check if it is up to 500 meters from the central coordinate of Betim campus.

The application enables the two criteria based on location. The first automatically search the current location of the device and shows on the map where you are. In the second criterion, the user enters a certain address and the application is responsible for finding on the map the location and determine whether or not it is within 500 meters.

The application works based on the coordinates and uses the Google Maps API to perform the calculations of distances in a straight line.
